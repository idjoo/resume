summary: >
  I'm a student at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in Cyber Security. My
  love for Linux sparked in 2019, and since then, it's been my go-to operating
  system. While my major revolves around Cyber Security, my true passion lies
  in exploring Linux, honing skills in Infrastructure and Deployment. I also
  thrive when immersed in Kubernetes, tinkering in my homelab, deploying
  applications, and engaging in related hands-on endeavors.
