summary: >
  A passionate DevOps and Infra Engineer. My love for Linux sparked in 2019, and since
  then, it's been my go-to operating system. While my major revolves around Cyber
  Security, my true passion lies in exploring Linux, honing skills in Infrastructure
  and Deployment. I also thrive when immersed in Kubernetes, tinkering in my homelab,
  deploying applications, and engaging in related hands-on endeavors.
