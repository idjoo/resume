summary: >
  A passionate DevOps and Infra Engineer. My love for Linux sparked in 2019,
  and since then, it's been my go-to operating system. While my major revolves
  around Cyber Security, my true passion lies in exploring Linux, honing skills
  in Infrastructure and Deployment. I also thrive when immersed in Kubernetes,
  tinkering in my homelab, deploying applications, and engaging in related
  hands-on endeavors.
